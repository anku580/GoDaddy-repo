# Getting Started with the project

## Steps to run the application

- Remove `package-lock.json` file if it is present.
- Run `npm install` command to download all the project dependecies.(it will take some time to download)
- Run `npm start` to start the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Runs the test cases, used Jest to write the test cases.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Tailwind CSS For Styling

A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

So, it saves alot of time and I was able to style the application.

## react-router-dom

Used react-router-dom to navigate in the application.

# Repository Structure

- components - All the reusable components are located in the `components` folder.
